This project includes a theme switcher that allows toggling between light and dark modes. The theme switcher is implemented using a `<span>` element with an icon that changes based on the current theme.

### Usage

- Click the theme switcher icon in the navigation bar to toggle between light and dark modes.
- The icon will change to a sun icon in dark mode and a moon icon in light mode.
- In dark mode, the icon color will be white, and in light mode, it will be black.
